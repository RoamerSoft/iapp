# Iapp
In this repository you can find some code of my graduation project. 
This is not the whole project because of some sensitive company information.
Only my functional code is available, but this gives a good picture of my code style.

I developed a cross platform mobile application (IOS, Android and the web) which facilitates the communication between a presenter and a big audience. 
The presenter is able to ask questions with the app by using, for example, a multiple-choice question on which the audience can respond. 
All the answers are received on the presenters second screen and he can use this new information in his presentation. Besides that, the audience is able to ask questions to the presenter by using the app as well.
